# Yelp-dataset-project

## Background of the project:
This project explores the factors that influence bar ratings based on the Yelp dataset. As a social place, the operating conditions and service quality of bars may be affected by many factors. By analyzing factors such as opening hours, certain attributes, and location, we sought to uncover these factors' potential impact on bars ratings.

## Project Objectives:
- Identify the key factors that influence a bar's rating.
- Analyze how opening hours, specific attributes, and location affect a bar's rating.
- Provides data-driven insights to help bar owners and managers optimize their business strategies, and improve ratings and customer satisfaction.
- Give suggestions for bad 

## Datasets and methods:
- We used the bar data set provided by the Univerisity of Wisconsin-Madison, which includes information such as opening hours, various attributes, and geographic location. The main analysis methods include data cleaning, feature selection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, and modeling. We utilize decision trees or other machine learning algorithms to identify which factors significantly impact bar ratings.

## Key findings:

- Certain periods of opening hours may be associated with higher ratings.
- Specific attributes may have some correlation with the bar rating.
- Geographical factors may also have an impact on bar ratings.

## project outcome:
The project produced a detailed report summarizing the exploratory analysis, model building, and key findings. Additionally, we developed an interactive Shiny-based application for presenting key findings and data visualizations. The results will be presented in reports and presentations and provide important insights for pub owners, managers, and relevant stakeholders.
